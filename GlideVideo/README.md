# GlideVideo

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-quantavil%2Fuserscript-181717?logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/quantavil/userscript)

**Mobile web video, actually usable.** Control playback, volume, brightness and zoom with touch gestures instead of fumbling for buttons built for a mouse.

## Install

Same code, two ways to run it. Pick one — don't install both, or you get two overlays.

### Userscript

Needs Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey. Works on any mobile browser that supports extensions: Firefox, Cromite, Kiwi, Orion, Edge.

**[→ Install GlideVideo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quantavil/userscript/main/GlideVideo/dist/glidevideo.user.js)**

To turn it off for one site, use **GlideVideo: Disable on \<site\>** in your userscript manager's menu.

### Firefox extension

No userscript manager needed. Build it with `bun run build:extension`, then load `dist-extension/` — permanently via `about:addons` → gear → *Install Add-on From File*, or for a quick try via `about:debugging` → *Load Temporary Add-on* → pick `manifest.json`.

To turn it off for one site, click the toolbar button; the page reloads without it. Click again to bring it back.

It asks for two permissions and no more: **storage** for your settings, and **activeTab** so the toolbar button can tell which site you're on. It collects nothing and talks to no server — everything stays in local storage on your device.

## Themes

Five overlay themes, each answering the same question a different way — *how do controls stay readable over footage you don't control?* **High Contrast** and **Frame** draw zero blurred layers: every `backdrop-filter` forces a readback of a video surface that repaints every frame, which is what actually costs frames on mobile. **Ember**, **Abyss**, and **Volt** accept that cost for a frosted/translucent look — pick them when you value feel over battery.

</p>

**High Contrast** · default — amber on near-opaque black; the only theme fully readable in direct sunlight or on a washed-out panel. Squared speed button.

**Frame** — hairline corner brackets, a 1px scrub line with frame ticks, one red playhead. The brackets fade with the rest of the controls, so nothing sits on the picture while you watch. Sharp-edged speed button.

**Ember** — warm-night cinema: bark-brown translucent surfaces with backdrop blur and an ember-orange glow. Squircle speed button.

**Abyss** — Ember's cold counterpart: deep-teal translucent surfaces with an ice-mint accent. Wavy-blob speed button.

**Volt** — brutalist signal: acid lime on near-black olive, monospace type, chunky 6px rail. Circular speed button.

## Gestures

The top bar holds the controls; the rest of the video is left clear for your thumbs.

| Gesture | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Double-tap | Left / right half | Skip back or forward. Keep tapping to stack — 10s, 20s, 30s |
| Swipe sideways | Anywhere | Scrub, with a live timestamp and offset |
| Swipe up / down | Right half | Volume |
| Swipe up / down | Left half | Brightness |
| Press and hold | Anywhere | 2× speed while held; release to restore |
| Pinch | Anywhere | Zoom, snapping to 50 / 100 / 125 / 150 / 200 / 300% |

In portrait, vertical swipes are handed back to the page so feeds still scroll. Gestures starting within 18px of a screen edge are ignored, so they don't collide with browser back-swipe.

---

## Controls

| | |
|---|---|
| **Speed** | `−` / `+` steps by 0.10×, hold to fine-tune by 0.05×. Tap the number to play/pause, long-press to reset to 1.00× |
| **Scrubber** | Optional seek bar (off by default, enable in Settings). Drag to seek or navigate with keyboard (`ArrowLeft`/`Right`, `Home`/`End`). Shows buffered range and a timestamp preview |
| **Aspect ratio** | Tap cycles Fit → Fill → Stretch. **Hold to rotate** 90° at a time — turns a portrait clip to fill a landscape screen, scaled to fit rather than just tipped on its side |
| **Lock** | Blocks every gesture, so a stray palm does nothing |
| **Picture-in-Picture** | Where the browser supports it |
| **Settings** | Below |

Prefer something smaller? **Minimal Speed FAB** swaps the speed pill for a single compact badge that cycles 0.5× → 2.0× on tap. It takes the active theme's button shape.

---

## Settings

| | |
|---|---|
| **Theme** | High Contrast (default), Frame, Ember, Abyss, or Volt |
| **Rotate** | 0° / 90° / 180° / 270°, also on a long-press of the aspect-ratio button |
| **Default speed** | Fallback speed for new videos |
| **Skip duration** | Seconds per double-tap skip, 5–300 |
| **Speed FAB** | Compact speed badge instead of the pill |
| **Left hand** | Mirrors controls and swaps volume/brightness rails for left thumb use |
| **Progress bar** | Show or hide the scrubber (disabled by default) |
| **Gestures** | Master switch |
| **Remember** | Restores position and speed when you come back |
| **Page scroll** | Keeps vertical page scrolling in portrait |
| **Reset all** | Back to defaults |

Toggles sit two to a line, so the whole sheet fits without scrolling on a phone.

Speed is remembered per domain, while the selected theme applies globally. Playback position is remembered per video, for the last 100. Zoom and rotation are per-video and reset on the next one, so a stray 90° never follows you around.

If a site keeps overriding your speed, GlideVideo pushes back three times, then says so in a toast and lets the site win rather than fighting in a loop.

### Accessibility & Keyboard Navigation

Every overlay control is fully navigable without touch:
- **Buttons & Toggles**: Tab through controls; toggle switches with `Space` or `Enter` (`role="switch"`, `aria-checked`).
- **Scrubber Bar**: Seek with `ArrowLeft` / `ArrowRight` (5s), `Home` (start), `End` (finish) with accessible `role="slider"`.
- **Vector UI & Motion**: Crisp inline SVG icons throughout (no font emoji dependencies) and full `prefers-reduced-motion` compliance.

## Build

TypeScript, Vite and Bun. Both targets build from the same `src/` — only the entry file differs. Architecture notes live in [`AGENT.md`](AGENT.md).

```bash
bun install
bun run dev                # live-reloading userscript, installs into your manager
bun run build              # both targets
bun run build:userscript   # → dist/glidevideo.user.js
bun run build:extension    # → dist-extension/  (Firefox MV3)
bun run tsc                # type check
bun run test               # vitest
bun run test:e2e           # Chromium touch/CSS smoke test
bun run lint               # biome
bun run lint:extension     # web-ext, validates the built extension
```

The extension is Manifest V3 with a `background.scripts` event page — Firefox does not run extension service workers. Its content script runs in an isolated world, which costs one thing the userscript has: videos inside *closed* shadow roots aren't reachable. Open shadow roots work in both.
